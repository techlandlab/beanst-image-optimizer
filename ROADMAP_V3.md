# BeanST Image Optimizer - V3.0 Roadmap (Pro/Premium)

This document outlines the proposed high-value features for future commercialization or advanced performance tiers.

## 1. 🤖 "True AI" Integration (Vision & Recognition)
- **Current**: Algorithmic SEO (pattern-based renaming and ALT suggestions).
- **Pro upgrade**:
    - **AI Alt-Text Generation**: Connectivity to **Google Gemini Vision** or **OpenAI GPT-4o** to actually "see" the image and write descriptive, accessible ALT tags.
    - **Smart Content-Aware Cropping**: Use AI to detect the "Region of Interest" (faces, products) and ensure primary subjects are never cropped out of thumbnails.
    - **AI Auto-Categorization**: Automatically tag images (e.g., "interior", "landscape", "person") for a searchable Media Library.
    - **AI Super-Resolution (Upscaling)**: Use neural networks to enlarge low-resolution images without loss of quality, perfect for user-generated content or old assets.

## 2. Cloud Optimization SaaS (API) ☁️
- **Target**: Users on restricted shared hosting without Ghostscript or Imagick.
- **Goal**: Offload intensive processing to a high-performance remote cluster. 
- **Monetization**: Credit-based system or monthly subscription.

## 2. Global CDN & Edge Delivery 🌐
- **Target**: High-traffic sites requiring ultra-low latency.
- **Goal**: Serve optimized WebP/AVIF images from global edge nodes (Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront integration).
- **Monetization**: Bandwidth-based billing.

## 3. Advanced Background Engine (WP-Cron/Action Scheduler) ⚙️
- **Target**: Large-scale stores (WooCommerce) with 10k+ assets.
- **Goal**: Full automation. No need to keep a browser tab open. Background workers process images in the background based on a schedule.
- **Monetization**: Feature unlock for Pro version.

## 4. Hybrid Storage & Cloud Backup 🛡️
- **Target**: Sites with limited disk space.
- **Goal**: Automatically move original backups to AWS S3, Google Cloud, or Dropbox after optimization.
- **Monetization**: Integration unlock.

## 5. Ultra-Premium UX (Blur-Up / LQIP) ✨
- **Target**: Modern, high-design portfolios.
- **Goal**: Implementation of "Low-Quality Image Placeholders" (LQIP). Images load instantly as blurred thumbnails and fade into full resolution.
- **Monetization**: Design-tier feature.

## 6. Real-time Compression Analysis 📊
- **Target**: Performance-obsessed SEO managers.
- **Goal**: Live dashboard showing "Carbon Footprint" savings and precise Lighthouse score impact before and after optimization.
